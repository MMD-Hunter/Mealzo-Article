            Their star dish, a perfectly seasoned fried chicken box, has become a local favourite. The chicken is crisp on the outside, tender inside and bursting with flavour that keeps customers coming back. Whether it is a midweek treat or a weekend indulgence, their boxes have become a staple in homes across the area.
